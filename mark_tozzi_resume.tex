\section{Summary}
Working in a startup environment, I have recently been involved in most 
aspects of web application development, from data modeling and analytics 
to template design and third party integration. Across all aspects of 
software development, I bring a strong “can do” attitude. I work hard to 
be the go to problem solver on any team, and pride myself on offering options 
and solutions instead of excuses. My core strength is in back-end data 
processing, including OLTP and OLAP applications, and I look forward to a 
position where I can continue to develop those skills.
