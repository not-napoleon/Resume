\section{Summary}
I am a software engineer with ten years experience, the last six working fully
remote, in the data engineering space.  I've focused on building high
throughput data pipelines for a range of applications and shapes of data.  I
have been involved in every step of developing a data-driven application, from
architecture and planning through implementation to maintenance and
monitoring.  I love solving hard problems and finding ways to make data
available to users in a meaningful way.

\section{Experience}
 {\bf Platform Developer,} Rocana, San Francisco, CA \hfill 2015--Present
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on a small, fully remote, team to build a customized search
        engine, backed by Lucene over HDFS
    \item Collaborated with a fully remote team spanning four timezones
    \item Built and debugged ETL pipeline to get records from Kafka to Lucene
    \item Used both code analysis and log analysis techniques to debug subtle
        threading issues in highly multi-threaded, callback based, architecture
    \item Employed pair programming techniques working with teammates to debug
        issues
    \item Advocated for, designed and built the first set of automated fault
        injection tests at the company.
    \item Worked on a batch query report framework using Spark Sql
    \item Worked with customer support to resolve tier 3 escalations in a
        timely fashion.
    \item Participated in customer support calls during escalations
    \item Partnered with project managers to break features down into tickets
        and plan milestone scopes
\end{itemize}

    over 1 million pages twice a day, using Celery and Flask to manage job
    requests and returning data
  \item Built machine learning models and web scraping tools using
    scikit-learn and beautiful soup to analyze and extract information from
    retailer websites and emails

    sets for minimal data footprint; we released a general implementation of
    this system as an open source project:
    \href{https://github.com/saltmine/redis-gadgets}{redis-gadgets}
  \item Migrated from pure Redis backend to hybrid Redis/Postgres backend,
      with no data loss and minimal downtime
  \item Practiced Test Driven Development (TDD) to dramatically lower the
