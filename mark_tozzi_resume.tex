\section{Summary}
Through my recent work in a startup environment, I have been involved in most
aspects of web application development, from data modeling and analytics
to template design and third party integration. I bring a strong “can do”
attitude, across all aspects of software development. I work hard to
be the go-to problem solver on any team, and pride myself on offering options
and solutions instead of excuses. My core strength is in back-end data
processing --- including OLTP and OLAP applications --- and I look forward to a
position where I can continue to develop those skills.
