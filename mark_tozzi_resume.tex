\section{Summary}
I am a software engineer with almost two decades of experience, most of it working
fully remote, in the data engineering space.  I've focused on building high
throughput data pipelines for a range of applications and shapes of data.
I have been involved in every step of developing a data-driven application,
from architecture and planning through implementation to maintenance and
monitoring.  I love solving hard problems and finding ways to make data
available to users in a meaningful way.
